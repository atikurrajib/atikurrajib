As a third-year Software Engineering student with hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, and React, I've developed a strong problem-solving mindset through academic projects and personal coding challenges. I particularly enjoy the process of taking a problem from concept to solution, paying attention to both system performance and user experience. My ability to stay focused under pressure helps me deliver quality work even with tight deadlines.
